Welcome to Calcoola!

A text-based assignments calculator written in Java.

The syntax is a subset of Java numeric expressions and operators. 

- You can use (positive/negative) numbers and variables as Operands
- You can use ++, --, +, -, *, /, % and ^^ (Power of 2) as Operators

Input Constraints:
- Whitespace is required before/after ++ and -- with respect to their position (i.e X++ ++X)
- Whitespace is required before positive/negative (+/-) Operands

At any stage, you can:
- Press p to print the computed variables
- Press r to clear the computation history
- Press q to exit
